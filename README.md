# CounterGame

## Description

Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of _2_. If it is, they divide it by _2_. If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of _2_. Whoever reduces the number to _1_ wins the game. Louise always starts.

Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.
